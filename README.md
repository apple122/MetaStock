## ⚙️ Getting Started & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or yarn
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account.

### 2. Setup Supabase Database

Before running the application, you need to set up your database schema.

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. Go to the **SQL Editor**.
3. Copy the entire contents of `src/lib/supabase_schema.sql` and run it.
   _(This script is fully idempotent and will automatically create all necessary tables, policies, and triggers.)_

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will typically start on `http://localhost:5173`.
